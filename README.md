Uma Project: Rhythm Derby
Uma Project: Rhythm Derby is a minimalist Uma‑inspired training and racing sim built with Next.js, Node.js, Tailwind, and MySQL. Train a tiny stable of runners in short rhythm sessions, then test them in one‑button horizontal races using the Lane Pulse system.

Features
Uma Creation & Management
Create and customize Uma characters with unique stats, temperament, and traits. Manage your stable, retire runners, and review their history.

Rhythm Training Mode
Choose a session type (Speed, Stamina, Technique, Mixed) and play a short click‑based rhythm mini‑game to shape your Uma’s stats and consume Energy.

Lane Pulse Racing
Race horizontally against AI in three phases (Start/Mid/Final). Click on beat to charge bursts, click off‑beat to switch lanes and line up with boost zones.

Progression & History
Persistent stats, training logs, and race records stored in MySQL. View past runs, placements, and how each Uma developed over time.
